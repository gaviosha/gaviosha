### Hello! 👋🏾

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am Fellow in Statistics at LSE. My academic interests mostly concern multiscale methods for detecting change points in time series data.

---

I’m currently working on ...
  * Some non-parametric change point problems in stochastic frontier analysis. 
  * Some problems concerning fast online change point detection using kernels. 
  * An online procedure for detecting the onset of unit roots. 
  
Upcoming talks and conferences...
  * I will give a talk at the [EcoSta](https://www.cmstatistics.org/EcoSta2025/organized.php) session on "Recent advances in change point detection". 

Still here? Why not listen to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3qx1hcBq1U).
