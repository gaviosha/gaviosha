### Hello! 👋🏾

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am Fellow at CityU Hong Kong. My academic interests mostly concern multi-scale statistics, change points and feature detection, and kernel methods. 

---

I’m currently working on 🧑🏾‍💻...
  * Some kernel based measures of pairwise and conditional dependence.  
  * Algorithms for robust change point inference.
  * Trading strategies based on sequential change point detection. 
  
Upcoming talks and conferences 💬...
  * I will be chairing a session at the [CityU Workshop in Econometrics and Statistics](https://cityu-es.com/).
  * I will give a talk at the [Asia Pacific
Rim Meeting](https://ims-aprm2026.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) session on "Advances in Change Point Detection and Dependence Structures in High Dimensions". 

Still here? Why not listen to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5clgTeBOFNw).
